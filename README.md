 I am mainly wanting to know where my art is going and to be used for also, for what 
 purposes, you know all those kind of things...etc. etc.
 
 ### Views
 
 All interpretations are my views/trying to emulate on what I have seen from other works. I 
 am trying to learn my own style, but still in the making, so to those I have taken parts 
 from, you are my **idols**, my **heroes**, the _people I follow_ and **inspire me**. 
 
 ## Goals:
 
 I will try to change this section, of the readme as I progress through web development, art
  skills, and as I progress through life. Its very hard to choose anymore what to do, where 
  to go, or what is the right choice. And I am on a goal to find my place in this world. 
  Part of that quest is finding my zen in art as well. So I am making it a goal to do some 
  kind of sketch art or something creative every week. 
  
  ### Art Comes In
  
  That is where the art site comes in, I have a goal, of becoming a better programmer, web 
  designer too. and thus building an art site to show off my art work has become apparently 
  needed. Something I could call my own. 'why when there are so many sites that do this 
  already?' you ask? Because I want something special for me, something I can call my own 
  little art site home, and hopefully build it up into a very nice art showcase single page 
  application. Or Pivot into something different after I get my skills. But thats where I am
   starting.
